# CS365 Scheduler Program

This scheduler program was written in Python 3.7+ and currently implements the multi-level non-aggressive scheduler and about half of the multi-level aggressive scheduler as outlined in the lab document.

## Setting up your environment
Before you try to get the app working, you'll need a valid Python 3 (3.7 or newer) [installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

In addition, you'll need to configure your pipenv environment and download required Python modules by running ```pipenv install```.

Once that's done, you will always need to start your development session by running ```pipenv shell```

**NOTE:** The instructions above should work in a Linux and macOS environment. However, I'm not 100% certain this will work in the Linux subsystem on Windows as I have not yet tried it out.

## Running the program

To run the program type in the following command below. (Assuming you're in "```pipenv shell```" mode)

```python coordinator.py```

### Command line options

To run the program with arguments, you would type in
```python coordinator.py [args]```


e.g. Help flag example:

```python coordinator.py -h```
